# Interactive maps of game worlds

The web application focused on providing visual guidance in the walkthrough of classic games, released mainly in the eighties and the first half of the nineties.
The application is focused primarily on games with non-linear locations or an open world that do not have automatic map generation tools.
Such games are usually very difficult to complete without the use of hints.
It is expected that this interactive application will lower the entry threshold for such games and allow players who do not want to memorize locations and game items in them on their own and spend a lot of time looking for what needs to be done in the game in order to advance further, to familiarize themselves with the classics.

This is a prototype application in a very early stage of development and it does not have a single complete game scenario, its own online version, and even its own name.

It is assumed that the application will contain two main modes of operation.

The first mode is offered as an alternative to large text descriptions of video game walkthroughs.
This mode is a step-by-step visual guide in the form of an interactive map, with a minimum amount of text, in which the player can mark their progress in the game by gradually opening or changing some parts of the game map.
Such a division into stages will allow not to reveal the entire plot of the game at once, hiding significant plot twists from the player.

The second mode is intended for those players who do not want to be led by the hand through the game world, and want to familiarize themselves with it, but do not want to memorize locations, or draw them on paper.
This mode is a map editor and provides a limited set of tools for quickly laying out key game objects and associated notes on a 2D grid.
